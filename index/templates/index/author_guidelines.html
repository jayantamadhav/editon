							<span style='color:#f66319'>These are general guidelines that apply to all listed Editon Consortium journals unless stated otherwise.</span>
							<br><br>
							To ensure the quality output of the knowledge resources in various fields, all Editon Consortium Journals are double blind peer reviewed (the author and the reviewer are not disclosed to each other during the review process). Strict criteria for quality, originality and significance apply to all articles in our journals in order to maintain a world-class reputation. Only members of the editorial board, who have been vetted, are involved in peer reviewing of manuscripts.
							<br><br>
							<span class='strong'>Review Process</span>
							<br><br>
							All submissions are made to the managing editor and copied to journal-specific chief editors. The paper is first subjected to anti-plagiarism check. If the paper is found to be plagiarized, it is rejected and immediate communication made to the author to revise or resubmit or make other decisions. If it is plagiarism free, the editor deletes the authors’ details, codes it and sends the coded manuscript to two reviewers. Once the reviewers are through, they send back the manuscript to the editor with comments and the author is given a chance to make corrections as per the reviewers’ directions. After revision, the authors return the revised manuscript to the editor who forwards them again to the first reviewers and the process begins again. The process is repeated until the reviewers and the editor are convinced that the manuscript is ready for publication. Note that papers can be rejected at any stage should the author fail to make corrections as guided. The chief editor ensures that all comments and suggestions given are fair and without bias. The speed of the process depends on the reviewers’ speed and the author’s ability to respond quickly. From our end, we endeavour to make the review process as quickly as possible; where a reviewer should not take more than five days. Communication is done, before assigning manuscripts to reviewers, to ensure the reviewer is in a position to complete the process within five days.
							<br><br>
							<span class='is-size-4' style='color:#f66319'>Evidence of peer review</span>
							<br>
							For the purposes of evidence of peer review; the author is provided with at least two reviews of their papers with comments after the process is completed. This evidence can be produced upon request by an employer or any other Quality control organisation.
							<br><br>
							<span class='is-size-3' style='color:#f61919'>Conflict of interests (Coi)</span>
							<br>
							Editon consortium journals recognise the conflict of interests that may arise where editors (managing editor and or editor-in-chief) and members of editorial boards submit papers in any of our journals and especially where they are editors or members of editorial boards. Measures are put in place to minimise the impact of conflicting interests at Editon Consortium. The peers in the consortium are also advised to understand that high quality and uncompromised research output is the backbone of academia.
							<br><br>
							<span class='is-size-4' style='color:#f66319'>a) Where the Managing editor submits a paper in any of the journals;</span>
							<br>
							In this case, the managing editor sends the paper directly to the editor-in-chief of such a journal. This also applies where a paper is submitted in which the managing editor is a co-author. The editor then handles the process as managing editor and makes no correspondence to the author. The paper is sent to the reviewers who return reports to the editor and the editor treats the author like any other. Requesting all corrections to be effected and ensuring due diligence is observed in the process of peer review to the end. The managing editor must also recognise that any compromise with the process results to low quality paper.
							<br><br>
							<span class='is-size-4' style='color:#f66319'>b) Where the editor-in-chief submits a paper in any of the journals;</span>
							<br>
							In case the editor-in-chief is submitting a paper (or a paper is submitted where s/he is a co-author) where he/she is editor, the managing editor handles the whole process by appointing a member of the editorial board as editor-in-chief for that particular paper.
							<br><br>
							<span class='is-size-4' style='color:#f66319'>c) Where a member of the editorial board submits a paper in a journal they are reviewers;</span>
							<br>
							In this case, the editor-in-chief must not in their assigning of reviewers assign them their papers or disclose the ownership to reviewers as per our double blind peer review policy. In all processes, due diligence must be observed to ensure papers are published without the conflict of interest compromising on quality.
							<br><br>
							<span class='is-size-3' style='color:#f61919'>Plagiarism policy</span>
							<br>
							All papers submitted at Editon Consortium journals are scanned for plagiarism once they are received in their original state and a report generated for the author. If the paper has manageable levels of plagiarism (up to 15%), the paper is send for review and if accepted, the acceptance certificate is sent to the author with the plagiarism report. The author is requested to reduce plagiarism to zero. Once the process is complete for the paper, the paper is scanned for the second time to ensure zero percentage of plagiarism.

							<br><br>
							<span class='is-size-3' style='color:#2a384e'>Editing Policy</span>
							<br><br>
							There are two ways editing is done at Editon Consortium. The author may choose to have their corrections effected by the Editon Consortium’s editorial team (this is only possible if the manuscript initial evaluation report scores a C; which means the manuscript is “Acceptable [with minor revisions/Editorial correction]”). Note in this case, the author has to authorise Editon editorial team through the managing editor otherwise they will be required to effect corrections. Secondly, the author may choose to effect suggested corrections themselves (They have no option if the initial evaluation report shows a need for heavy editing and revision). Either way, it does not affect the cost; however, when revision is possible to be done from our end it saves on the processing time.
							<br><br>
							<span class='is-size-3' style='color:#2a384e'>Publication Terms:</span>
							<br><br>
							<span class='strong'>Warranty</span>: Every author, by submitting their manuscript to any of our journals, warrant that the material is not published or under review for publication in another place and that the manuscript is original. The authors warrant that the manuscript is their work (not belonging to another person or group of persons) and that Editon Consortium Publishing has authority to publish and publicize the manuscript. That unless the author has given specific journal, the publisher has the authority to allocate a journal article to appropriate journal and communicate to them during the first communication after acknowledgement of the receipt of the manuscript. Should the author agree with the selected journal or fail to raise any objection at this stage, it will be deemed as his preferred choice and the publisher will not be held accountable thereafter.
							<br><br>
							The authors also declare by publishing in any of our journals that Editon Consortium publishing and its associated organs can make adjustments, share and make it available to databases indexed by the journals now and in future and or distribute the manuscript without any limitations whatsoever.
							
							<br><br>
							<span class='strong'>Processing Charges</span>
							<br><br>
							Normal processing of articles takes at most two weeks. The fast process can take 48 hours.
							<br><br>
							Acceptance certificate is normally issued once the manuscript has gone through the first round of review and accepted for publication. This should be within five days after submission. However, acknowledgement is given as soon as the article is submitted, or not later than 24 hours.
